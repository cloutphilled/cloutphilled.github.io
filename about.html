                You are probably wondering what's going on and/or what the purpose of this project it. 
                As part of my bachelor's degree in 'Digital Concept Development' I had to produce a concept from scratch.
                I chose to focus the concept on my band 'TELOS' and our upcoming 2022 album 'DELUDE'.
                I play guitar in TELOS which is a blackened hardcore/mathcore band. We are part of the DIY hardcore scene in Copenhagen, Denmark.

                <i>So what does all this have to do with a webpage?</i> 
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, I wanted to create new digital way of presenting music to the user.
                In the world of today the user typically use streaming tools like Spotify, Apple Music or even YouTube to listen to a piece of music.
                In a sense it's a very homogenous way of listening to music since it's universally the same method across all music genres.
                Hardcore as a music genre is very harsh and unforgiven to new users. That's how I felt about it at least.
                It's not easy on the ears and it requires patience and 'practice' from the user in order to be enjoyable.
            </p>
            <p>
                So in my thesis I wanted the concept to represent the values of Hardcore.
                Of course this also means that the visual presentation should be true to the visual style of TELOS, which in itself is rooted in Hardcore culture.
                Since the music requires a great deal of endurance from the user, like wise should the mechanic of getting the music to play too.
                The user shouldn't just press a 'play' button in order for the music to play. Instead the user should be required to perform a desired action.
                This was also rooted in the theory of 'System 1 & 2' by Daniel Kahneman. This theory deals with how the brain functions.
            </p>
       
            <p>
               <b>System 1</b> is the automatic and fast part of the brain. You usually don't think about 2 + 2 = ? or how to get a song to play in Spotify. 
               This is the intuitve system and lot of UX-design is focused on System 1 when designing the user-experience. 
               This makes a lot of sense since most products and/or designs want the required effort from the user to be as easy as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>System 2</b> is the slower system. It's concious and calculated and also uncormfortable because thinking requires effort.
                If you had to solve 16 x 23 = ? in your head, it would require effort and time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hardcore clearly forces System 2 to be active for new users. This should also be expressed in the way the user gets the music to play in this project.
                When the desired action has not been performed 'Noise' will be present and when the desired action is performed the music plays while the noise disappears.
